Mini Project Dated: 6/18/2024 

### In June of the year of our lord 2024...

I was learning Russian nouns and training myself to recognize the difference between masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns. An oversimplified pattern emerged (yes I know there are exceptions): 
> masculine nouns **in infinitive form** end in a consonant, feminine in -a, and neuter in -o. 

However, there are some nouns that end in ь which may be **either** masculine or feminine. So my question - out of the first 10,000 most commonly used Russian nouns ending in ь what's the proportion of feminine to masculine words? 

If I took a guess while looking at some unfamiliar noun (inf.) ending in ь maybe I could guess with a bias favoring either masculine or feminine based on which showed up more. 

Using a little bit of statistics, I was able to find a significant association between the relative frequency (ipm) score of nouns on this 10,000 word list, and the gender of these words. As for my sources - I was able to get the first 10,000 most commonly used words (a list which might change from resource to resource) from this resource : [https://ruscorpora.ru/en/](https://ruscorpora.ru/en/ "https://ruscorpora.ru/en/")
